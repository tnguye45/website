  <h1>Tra Nguyen</h1>
  <p>
    Hi, everybody! My name is Tra, and I am an international student from Hanoi,
Vietnam (if you do not know where it is, Vietnam War may be the keyword for
you). I am currently finishing my Bachelor of Architecture with minor in
Construction Management and will be graduating in May 2018.

    I am so excited but also nervous at the same time. This semester, I am taking 18
credit hours and have a part-time internship. Besides that, I am an event chair
of iitAIAS, which is American Institute of Architecture Student. I take this
class because I want to know how to design my own website without depending on
another service. In addition, it is pretty interesting to have a humanities class
but it looks like a CS course. After the first two class, my difficulties are
trying to understand the concept and terminology of the area as well as try to
understand the logic of coding. I usually take a long time to understand a
certain problem than the other's, but I hope I can understand it by the end of
the semester.

    OK! That is a general background of me at IIT. Now, I will talk more about
myself. From my friends’ perspective, I am a combination of funny, boring, funky,
crazy, shy, girly, and manly. The reason is that I have a lot of guy’s friends
back in my country. I hang out with them a lot that I can understand all there
dirty joke. Besides that, I always help them out with their relationship,
especially when they are in one-sided love. What I do for them at that time is
just listening to their story and saying "You are pathetic!" I almost got hit by
my friend for saying that but manage to escape and brought them laugh so it
worth it. In addition, I like soccer very much. I usually hang out with my
friends and play with them even though I am terrible at it. The best position I
play is a defender. It sounds so professional but all I do is to ascertain that
the other's team striker cannot score. That is pretty easy because they do want
to get me injured so they play easily on me. Once time when I played as a goal
keeper, my friend tried to score the goal but I managed to catch it. However,
since he was trying to kick the ball with great strength, it hurt my chest so
bad when I caught the ball. I was sitting down and tried to calm my breath for
five minutes. Besides that, I like watching soccer very much and have been
watching it since 2002. Back home, I usually watched soccer tournaments with my
entire family. It was a good time since we all stayed up until 3 AM to scream
and cheer for different teams. Sometimes, it was a little bit difficult for me
because I got so emerged with the game that I swear out of conscious, and my mom
was sitting next to me. You know that feeling right? I got a warning from her just
like the yellow card in the game, and sometimes she almost slapped me for
swearing during the game. It was very difficult for me to be serene and cautious
when watching the soccer game. My favorite soccer team is Arsenal, and I have
supported them since 2004. Their playing style is attractive and comprehensive.
Right now, I am thinking of not supporting them anymore as they have not been
winning any big title since then as well as my heart has been weakening whenever I
watch them play the game. I think maybe I am not a lucky fan for them. Arsenal
had come to Vietnam during their summer tour once, and it was a precious
experience to me as I got the ticket to watch them play and scream with all
other fans in the stadium. My dream is to get a ticket to watch Arsenal play in
their home stadium in London, England, and one day, I hope I can design their
next stadium *fingers cross*

    Besides being a crazy fan of soccer, I like to enjoy myself in the nice weather.
I always feel happy when the weather is a little bit cold but the sun is shining
bright with a little bit of wind blowing. These combinations make the air so
fresh and pure. In these weather, I love walking under the row of trees with my
head looks up to the sky to enjoy the blue sky. Sometimes, I even close my eyes
and walk or bike with my hands off the bike to feel the wind and the breeze. If
you see me these days, you will probably see me doing that with an addition of
singing/ screaming.

    Lastly, I just want to thank Pr. Stolley for helping me with this project on the
weekend at midnight *thumbs up*
