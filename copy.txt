Hi everybody, My name is Tra, and I am an international student from Hanoi,
Vietnam (if you do not know where it is, Vietnam War may be the keyword for
you). I am currently finishing my bachelor of Architecture with minor in
Construction Management and will be graduating in May 2018. I am so excited but
also nervous at the same time. This semester, I am taking 18 credit hours and
have a part-time internship. Besides that, I am an event chair of iitAIAS, which
is American Institute of Architecture Student. I take this class because I want
to know how to design my own website without depending on other service. In
addition, it is pretty interesting to have a humanities class but it looks like
a CS course. After the first two class, my difficulities are trying to
understand the concept and terminology of the area as well as try to understand
the logic of coding. I usually take a long time to understand a certain problem
than the other's, but I hope I can understand it by the end of the semester.
